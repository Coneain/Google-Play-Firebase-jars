# Google-Play-Firebase-jars

This Github repository has all the .jar files based on the latest Google Play Services and Google Firebase SDK .aar files.


After the google play services update version 30, the `google-play-services.jar` is missing from the Android SDK folder and a few `.aar` files have taken its position.

Ths Github repository has all the `.jar` files based on the .aar files of the latest Google Play Services and Google Firebase SDK you can find in the `<AndroidSDK>\extras\google\m2repository\com\google\firebase` and `<AndroidSDK>\extras\google\m2repository\com\google\android\gms`
